# Playbook Pipeline (Deprecated)

## Status
Playbook-driven investigation orchestration is deprecated in the active pipeline.

Current orchestration uses deterministic enrichment-tool planning directly from unresolved non-deterministic signals.

## Historical Files Kept for Reference
- `/Users/gabe/Documents/Phishing_Triage_Agent_Mailbbox_Plug- in/Playbooks/playbook_selector.py`
- `/Users/gabe/Documents/Phishing_Triage_Agent_Mailbbox_Plug- in/Playbooks/playbook_library.yaml`

These files remain in-repo for historical context and migration support, but `Investigation_Agent/investigation_pipeline.py` no longer depends on them.
